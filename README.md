R studio

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while it seems like France would continue to dominate its home nation race, it may no longer be the case. Globalization has led to a more diversified Tour and resulted in a greater number of other European countries to moving up the rankings of total tour and stage wins. Based on our analysis, more wins could be expected from Britain and Spain, with Germany showing great stage winning presence, and perhaps also more Eastern European countries, such as Slovakia, emerging to take on the challenge of the tour.

It is also possible to conclude that a countryâ€™s geographical characteristics may lead to preferential outcomes in each stage type, as demonstrated by the examples of Spain and the Netherlands in the Mountain and Flat stage types respectively. It can be observed that the total number of stage wins are not necessarily directly linked to tour wins, and this may be due to the fact that the tour is not a race for countries to compete in but multi-nation teams compete for the top prize. It may be that team managers could look to this to select riders from different national terrains to make up their teams.

It would be useful if this data set also included nationality of all riders to support extending this analysis.
